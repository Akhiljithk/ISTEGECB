        <p>
            Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.

            Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.

To  inspect buildings, against regulations for public health, fire safety, energy conservation and sustainability and building accessibility,etc. It is either duty to advise applicants on changes to ensure legal requirements are met, issue conditional approval, subject to other steps being included in the process and grant approval for work to commence.It also includes communicating  with members of the public, councilors, construction professionals and statutory bodies, e.g. highways, planning and environmental health departments.The role of a building control surveyor is open to graduates of all degrees. However, particularly relevant subjects include architecture, building control, building surveying, civil engineering, construction studies and  structural engineering .</p>

To communicate effectively with the clients, colleagues and contractors involved in a project.You can enter design engineering by both vocational and academic routes. Graduate-level engineers will in most cases be required to have a degree in a relevant technical subject such as civil, mechanical, electrical or chemical engineering. In some cases, non-relevant degrees will be considered and it may be possible to undertake a postgraduate conversion course.To become a professionally incorporated engineer (IEng) or chartered engineer (CEng), you'll first need an undergraduate degree (BSc, BEng). Some courses will offer the opportunity to undertake a year's work placement in industry.
                            Completion of a Masters (MSc, MEng) is a requirement of working towards becoming a fully chartered engineer, and can allow you to specialise in a particular area. Some employers may allow you to study part-time towards your Masters degree.

                        <p>To understand the science behind how nuclear facilities work, analyse energy transmission, conversion and storage systems . To solve design or operational problems with reactor cores and shielding, hydraulic and electrical systems, and complex instrumentation such as monitoring equipment etc. To manage staff and budgets for complex design, construction, maintenance, expansion, safety and decommissioning projects. To interpret data and respond to emerging issues to ensure equipment is always working properly.Nuclear engineering is a specialist field, so the level of competition is moderate. If you have a strong record at university and at least some related work experience as a student, prospects are reasonably good. However, as in all specialist fields, a downturn or surge in demand can change the picture quickly.

                            Employers usually ask for a degree or HNC/HND in a construction-related or engineering discipline. The following subjects, in particular, may increase your chances of securing employment:
                            <ul>
                               <li>building engineering</li>

                            To progress to chartered membership of a relevant professional body, it's important that your degree is accredited and meets the body's academic requirements for membership. The main professional body in construction is the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB), while in engineering the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and The Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE) are the key professional bodies in the field.

                        <p>As a fire risk assessor, you'll need to: work carefully to follow strict fire safety legislation and guidelines set by the government and fire and rescue services 
                            identify hazards and assess the potential risk of a fire breaking out in the building you're working in.  Keep up to date with changes in the guidelines to fire safety by reading documents such as the Government Fire Safety Order. Work with others, such as fire services, buildings and facilities managers, surveyors, fire engineers and landlords to develop, amend and implement fire safety plans. To provide fire safety advice to clients, both verbally and in a detailed written report which can include a fire safety action plan. To take responsibility for your continuing professional development (CPD), to learn changes in regulation and developments in fire safety. To deliver training on fire safety in some roles.
                            Higher education isn't necessary but a degree in fire safety, building surveying or a health and safety related subject can help. Having a broader degree in a subject such as civil engineering can be helpful, although this isn't a specific requirement.

                        <p>To protect human health,protect nature's beneficial ecosystems, and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life.Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health. They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advice on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.Environmental engineering or environmental systems courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment.Environmental chemistry, sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects of chemicals in the environment, including any mining processes, pollutants, and also biochemical processes.Environmental technology courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources.

                        <p>Transport engineers are responsible for planning, designing and overseeing the construction and maintenance of civil engineering projects relating to transport networks, such as roads, bridges, mass transit stations, railways, airports and harbours.The work of transport engineers aims to optimise traffic flow, improve mobility and safety, and minimise harmful emissions in all transport systems, at efficient cost. Transport engineering involves the analysis and evaluation of traffic signals, signs and markings, as well as the conditions of the environment surrounding the infrastructure.
                            Transportation engineers must have bachelor's degrees in civil engineering. Nearly half of those working today hold master's degrees or doctorates, which may be required for teaching and research positions. Prospective transportation engineers should take high school courses in mathematics and science.
